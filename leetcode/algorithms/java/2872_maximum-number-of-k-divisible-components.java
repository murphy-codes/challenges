/****************************************
* 
* There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You
* _ are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`,
* _ where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes
* _ `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.
* You are also given a 0-indexed integer array `values` of length `n`, where
* _ `values[i]` is the value associated with the `i^th` node, and an integer `k`.
* A valid split of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly
* _ empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that
* _ are divisible by `k`, where the value of a connected component is the sum
* _ of the values of its nodes.
* Return the maximum number of components in any valid split.
*
* Example 1:
* [Image: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/07/example12-cropped2svg.jpg]
* Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], values = [1,8,1,4,4], k = 6
* Output: 2
* Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 1 with 2. The resulting split is valid because:
* - The value of the component containing nodes 1 and 3 is values[1] + values[3] = 12.
* - The value of the component containing nodes 0, 2, and 4 is values[0] + values[2] + values[4] = 6.
* It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 2 connected components.
*
* Example 2:
* [Image: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/07/example21svg-1.jpg]
* Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [3,0,6,1,5,2,1], k = 3
* Output: 3
* Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 0 with 2, and the edge connecting node 0 with 1. The resulting split is valid because:
* - The value of the component containing node 0 is values[0] = 3.
* - The value of the component containing nodes 2, 5, and 6 is values[2] + values[5] + values[6] = 9.
* - The value of the component containing nodes 1, 3, and 4 is values[1] + values[3] + values[4] = 6.
* It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 3 connected components.
*
* Constraints:
* • `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^4`
* • `edges.length == n - 1`
* • `edges[i].length == 2`
* • `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`
* • `values.length == n`
* • `0 <= values[i] <= 10^9`
* • `1 <= k <= 10^9`
* • Sum of `values` is divisible by `k`.
* • The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
