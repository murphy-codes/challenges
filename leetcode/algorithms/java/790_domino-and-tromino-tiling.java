/****************************************
* 
* You have two types of tiles: a `2 x 1` domino shape and a tromino shape
* _ (three squares in an L-shape or an R-shape). You may rotate these shapes.
* [Image: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino.jpg]
* Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an `2 x n` board.
* _ Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.
* In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are
* _ different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells
* _ on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares
* _ occupied by a tile.
*
* Example 1:
* [Image: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino1.jpg]
* Input: n = 3
* Output: 5
* Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
*
* Example 2:
* Input: n = 1
* Output: 1
*
* Constraints:
* â€¢ 1 <= n <= 1000
