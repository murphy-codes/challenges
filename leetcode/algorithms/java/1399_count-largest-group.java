/****************************************
* 
* You are given an integer `n`.
* Each number from `1` to `n` is grouped according to the sum of its digits.
* Return the number of groups that have the largest size.
*
* Example 1:
* Input: n = 13
* Output: 4
* Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
* [1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
* There are 4 groups with largest size.
*
* Example 2:
* Input: n = 2
* Output: 2
* Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.
*
* Constraints:
* â€¢ 1 <= n <= 10^4
*

class Solution {
    // Groups numbers 1 to n by the sum of their digits, then finds how many
    // groups have the largest size. Uses an array for digit sums (max 36).
    // Time: O(n) for computing digit sums and tracking frequencies.
    // Space: O(1), since array size is fixed and independent of input n.
    // Fast and elegant due to bounded digit sums and direct array access.
