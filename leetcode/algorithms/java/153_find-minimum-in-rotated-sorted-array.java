/****************************************
* 
* Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between
* _ `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:
* • `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
* • `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.
* Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time
* _ results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.
* Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the
* _ minimum element of this array.
* You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.
*
* Example 1:
* Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
* Output: 1
* Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
*
* Example 2:
* Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
* Output: 0
* Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
*
* Example 3:
* Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
* Output: 11
* Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
*
* Constraints:
* • `n == nums.length`
* • `1 <= n <= 5000`
* • `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
* • All the integers of `nums` are unique.
* • `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.
*

    // Use binary search to locate the rotation pivot / minimum element.

    // Otherwise, minimum is at mid or within the left half.

        int left = 0;

            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Minimum must be to the right of mid
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            // Minimum is at mid or to the left
